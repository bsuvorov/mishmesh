MishMesh
========
iOS library for viewing 3D files. Delivered in the form of a static library which exposes everything you need to render 3D meshes. This repository includes a sample app project which demonstrates how this work can be easily integrated into another project. A quick demo of this library's features can be seen here: <http://youtu.be/ahDldv0AnMc>

Limitations
===========
- *File Formats*: Currently, only the obj file format is supported, however, it is trivial to add parsers for other file types. Support for this file format was implemented first due to both its popularity and simplicity. Support for 3ds is planned next.
